Email/SMS spam detection

It is a spam detection model which is trained on the RandomForest classifier. Actually, I tried on Naive Bayes too, both has 100% precision score but according to my training data the accuracy score is of RandomForest is around 97% whereas that of Naive Bayes is 95%.
So, thats the reason i choose random forest as my algorithm.
